# Rory-Emma-Stopwatch

## What
A javascript stopwatch which runs in the browser.

## Why
The stopwatch is created using TDD principles to practice TDD.

## How

### Count
This variable a count of the time that has elapsed. It will exist initially as milliseconds but may be developed into a seconds, minutes and hours format. It will start at zero.

### Start
This is a function that causes our Count variable to increment steadily over time.

### Stop
This stops our Start function from incrementing the Count and freezes the Count variable.

### Reset
This sets the Count variable to 0.

### Display
All of the above should be made visible to the user through a display which has the Count variable as a number and the start, stop and reset as buttons.
